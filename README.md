The 1969 Moon Landing (Educational)


Introduction - “Cheat Sheets”  



“Cheat-Sheets” is an educational web-based resource aimed at educators and pupils studying the junior cycle.The idea is to give pupils of all levels and “easy in” to multi-faceted events by providing them with an engaging yet simplified version of the event as a whole under the following headings : Why When Where and How. As sturgeons ( censored) law states: 90% of everything is waffle. Cheat-sheets aims at relating the remaining 10% that students need  to know in a way that is both memorable and exciting.

Landing Page
The landing page is our first introduction to the pupil hence this has been designed as if it’s a game. The perspective of the lunar shuttle and stars moving give an exciting pov experience as if the pupil themselves witnessed the event. The layered parallax effect responds when the user scrolls instilling a sense of agency within the learning environment.  This can also lead to a greater sense of confidence in the pupils who otherwise may feel daunted by history traditionally. They - literally - move and learn at their own pace.

Navigation Bar
The navigation bar consists of links to each section of the page for a quick reminder so that students can refer to  them again and again.
Information  Pages

Designed like an interactive flashcard- it gives as much (relevant) information concisely as as possible. The parallax effect continues from the landing page but in a more pared back fashion to allow the content to stand out. The accompanying images “revealing “ themselves creates a surprise element that holds the attention of pupils. It also acts as a visual anchor for the information they need to remember. The goal ultimately is to limit bounce rate and increase curiosity.

Video Gallery

For good measure we’ve also given some relative youtube links that will make the entire experience come truly alive. It can be jumped to on its own but, it also fits in the natural flow of the page acting as a reward in the same fashion that video games often adopt : Engagement -Task-Cutscene.

Signup 
An easy signup section that allows you to avail of ( or even request) more cheat sheets!

Testing 

W3W HTML Validator
The majority of the errors that came back were to do with errors in which elements could be parents and children of each other . 

EX . Error: The value of the for attribute of the label element must be the ID of a non-hidden form control.
From line 75, column 9; to line 75, column 46

I attempted to rectify this in codeacademy, however the structure of the website as is was compromised. I will work on learning more about this going forward.

I also had an issue with similar divs responding differently to media queries. For example Sec and SecC display differently despite being the same layout. I tried multiple times to fix all the sections but didn’t manage to before the deadline. I will work on this going forward and how it related to the above.


Jigsaw valigator

3 minor errors were returned. I have now fixed these.

GTMetrix (Website Speed) 

This test came back with a Grad A https://gtmetrix.com/reports/marmar793.github.io/S7eL79Uy/
Considering that this is a responsive website aimed at catching the attention of junior cycle pupils , I’m happy with this. 


Deployment

I had initially tried to push the code directly from Code Anywhere but when issues emerged, I decided to upload a zip file of the code from my computer.

I created a repository, uploaded the file in full and then edited the images to reflect their srcs to be from assets/.
I then pushed (commit?) the code via the council with the branch specified as main.
After this had been completed I selected GitHub pages and selected Deploy from a branch. I selected Main and Root. I then pressed save.


Student Notes 

Coding Diary 

As I was unfamiliar with github until very recently , I saved copies of the development stages to another file. These have now been copied into GitHubs “gist” section which you can find here:
